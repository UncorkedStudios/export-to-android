# Android Assets for Photoshop


A Photoshop script for exporting assets for Android projects.

The script works by duplicating the selected layer (or layergroup) to a new document, then scaling it to each of the 5 most common Android sizes (XXXHDPI, XXHDPI, XHDPI, HDPI, and MDPI) and then placing the files inside a folder next to the PSD.

## Installation
