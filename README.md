# Android Assets for Photoshop


A Photoshop script for exporting assets for Android projects.

The script works by duplicating the selected layer (or layergroup) to a new document, then scaling it to each of the 5 common Android sizes (XXHDPI, XHDPI, HDPI, MDPI, and LDPI) and then putting the files inside a folder next to the PSD.

## Installation
1. Download the script here

2. Move the .jsx file to your Photoshop scripts folder. If you don't know where that is, you can easily find out by following the instructions <a href="http://www.outbackphoto.net/news/2013/2/17/free-script-where-is-my-photoshop-scripts-folder.html" target="_blank">on this quick post</a>.
